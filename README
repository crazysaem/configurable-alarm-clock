How to compile:

use "git clone" to clone the entire repository to your harddisc.

Make sure you have version 15 of the Android SDK and the Android Eclipse Plugin, and Android 2.2 (API_LEVEL 8) as a compile platform

In Eclipse you will probably get the Error that R.java is missing.
You have to generate it.
Either try 'Right-Click on Project'->'Android Tools'->'Fix Project Properties'
and/or try (at the top menu) 'Project'->'Clen...'
